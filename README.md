# GPImageClassification

## About

In the project, we proposed a genetic programming based method that utilizes the tools of convolutional neural networks and evolutionary algorithms to automatically evolve a tree that will be able to classify images. With such an approach we aim to produce relatively simple, easily visualizable results that will evolve automatically without manual model creation.
